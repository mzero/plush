Grouping Compound Commands

A brace group can have one or more commands
    # { echo hello; }
    hello
    # { echo hello; echo world; }
    hello
    world

Exit code of the brace group, is the exit of the last command
    # { true ; false ; } ; echo $?
    1
    # { false ; true ; } ; echo $?
    0

Changes inside the brace group, affect the outer environment
    # x=1
    # { x=2; echo $x; }
    2
    # echo $x
    2

    # mkdir sub
    # touch apple-pie sub/apple-jack
    # echo apple-*
    apple-pie
    # { cd sub; echo apple-*; }
    apple-jack
    # echo apple-*
    apple-jack
