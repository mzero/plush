Read into a var

    # unset IFS

Trailing whitespace is removed
    N.B.: can't use a pipeline as read is then in a subshell
    # mkdir /tmp/doctest
    # cd /tmp/doctest

    # echo 'one   ' > input
    # read a b <input ; recho "$a" "$b"
    argv[1] = <one>
    argv[2] = <>

    # echo 'one   ' > input
    # read -r a b <input ; recho "$a" "$b"
    argv[1] = <one>
    argv[2] = <>

    # echo 'one two three  ' > input
    # read a b <input ; recho "$a" "$b"     # SKIP dash retains trailing here
    argv[1] = <one>
    argv[2] = <two three>

    # echo 'one two three  ' > input
    # read -r a b <input ; recho "$a" "$b"  # SKIP dash retains trailing here
    argv[1] = <one>
    argv[2] = <two three>

    only trailing trailing IFS whitespace, not trailing IFS separators
    # IFS=' ,'
    # echo 'one two three , ' > input
    # read a b <input ; recho "$a" "$b"     # SKIP dash retains trailing here
    argv[1] = <one>
    argv[2] = <two three ,>

    # echo 'one two three , ' > input
    # read -r a b <input ; recho "$a" "$b"  # SKIP dash retains trailing here
    argv[1] = <one>
    argv[2] = <two three ,>

    # unset IFS
    # cd
    # rm -rf /tmp/doctest

Reads only one line
    # read a b c <<\END; recho "$a" "$b" "$c"
    + one
    + two
    + three
    + four
    + END
    argv[1] = <one>
    argv[2] = <>
    argv[3] = <>

    Reads more if there is line continuation
    # read a b c <<\END; recho "$a" "$b" "$c"
    + one \
    + two\
    + three
    + four
    + END
    argv[1] = <one>
    argv[2] = <twothree>
    argv[3] = <>

    But not if there is -r
    # read -r a b c <<\END; recho "$a" "$b" "$c"
    + one \
    + two\
    + three
    + four
    + END
    argv[1] = <one>
    argv[2] = <\>
    argv[3] = <>

Backslashes quote anything (except new lines)
    # read a b c <<\END; recho "$a" "$b" "$c"
    + \\\hello\ world\,\ planet\\
    + END
    argv[1] = <\hello world, planet\>
    argv[2] = <>
    argv[3] = <>

The -r flag defeats this
    # read -r a b c <<\END; recho "$a" "$b" "$c"
    + \\\hello\ world\,\ planet\\
    + END
    argv[1] = <\\\hello\>
    argv[2] = <world\,\>
    argv[3] = <planet\\>

But what if backslash is in IFS?
    # IFS=" \\"
    # read a b c <<\END; recho "$a" "$b" "$c"
    + 1\2\3\4\5
    + END
    argv[1] = <12345>
    argv[2] = <>
    argv[3] = <>

    # read a b c <<\END; recho "$a" "$b" "$c"
    + 1\\2\\3\\4\\5
    + END
    argv[1] = <1\2\3\4\5>
    argv[2] = <>
    argv[3] = <>

    # read -r a b c <<\END; recho "$a" "$b" "$c"
    + 1\2\3\4\5
    + END
    argv[1] = <1>
    argv[2] = <2>
    argv[3] = <3\4\5>

    # read -r a b c <<\END; recho "$a" "$b" "$c"
    + 1\\2\\3\\4\\5
    + END
    argv[1] = <1>
    argv[2] = <>
    argv[3] = <2\\3\\4\\5>

    # unset IFS
