Subshells need to execute without affecting the shell state

Working directory stays the same
    # mkdir /tmp/doctest
    # cd /tmp/doctest
    # mkdir sub
    # (cd sub; echo hi > message; echo *)
    message
    # echo *
    sub
    # cat sub/message
    hi
    # cd /tmp
    # rm -rf /tmp/doctest

Parameters and environment variables
    # set pre-arg
    # (set post-arg new-arg; echo $# $@)
    2 post-arg new-arg
    # echo $# $@
    1 pre-arg

    # x=pre-shell-var
    # (x=post-shell-var z=new-shell-var; echo $x $z)
    post-shell-var new-shell-var
    # echo $x =$z=
    pre-shell-var ==

    # export y=pre-export-var
    # (export y=post-export-var z=new-export-var; echo $y $z)
    post-export-var new-export-var
    # echo $y =$z=
    pre-export-var ==

Functions
    # f() { echo pre-function; }
    # ( f() { echo post-function; }; f )
    post-function
    # f
    pre-function

Options
    # set +$- -m
    # (set -a; echo $-)
    am
    # echo $-
    m

    # (set -x; echo hello)
    .+ echo hello
    hello
    # echo world
    world

Aliases
Note: you can't test that an alias set inside the subshell is used within the
subshell because the whole subshell expression is subject to alias expansion
before it is run. Hence in the test the subshell still prints 'hi,'
    # shopt -s expand_aliases       # ONLY bash
    # alias greet='echo hi,'
    # (alias greet='echo yo,'; greet Ferb)
    hi, Ferb
    # greet Ferb
    hi, Ferb


TODO(mzero): Things left to test that shouldn't affect the parent shell,
once implemented:
    - open file descriptors changed by exec
    - umask changes
    - trap changes
    - process ids from async lists
