Alias Commands

Start with a blank slate
    # shopt -s expand_aliases       # ONLY bash
    # unalias -a
    # alias

Simple command usage
bash is skipped here because its output is non-compliant
    # alias aaa=apple
    # alias | tr \" \'              # SKIP bash
    aaa='apple'
    # alias bbb=banana ccc=casava
    # alias aaa bbb ccc | tr \" \'  # SKIP bash
    aaa='apple'
    bbb='banana'
    ccc='casava'
    # unalias bbb
    # alias | fgrep bbb
    # unalias -a
    # alias



Alias Substition

Start with a blank slate
    # unalias -a
    # alias

Simple
    # alias say=echo
    # say hi
    hi
    # alias greet='echo yo,'
    # greet bob
    yo, bob

But only in first position
    # echo say
    say
    # echo greet
    greet
    # say say
    say

A space at the end, induces further alias substition
    # alias alex='echo expands to '
    # alex echo
    expands to echo
    # alex say
    expands to echo
    # alex greet
    expands to echo yo,

Commands can be aliased to themselves, without infinite repeat
    # alias du=du\ -k
    # alex du
    expands to du -k

Alias can be chained
    # alias diskusage=du
    # alex diskusage
    expands to du -k

Alias can be mutually chained
    # alias one='two too'
    # alias two='one won'
    # alex one
    expands to one won too
    # alex two
    expands to two too won

Bizarre things can happen with spaces at the end
    # alex alex
    expands to echo expands to
    # alias bob='alex say'
    # bob apples
    expands to echo apples
