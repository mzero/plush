Positional Parameters

The shell parameters are numbered from 1 up
    # set one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
    # echo $1 $4 $9
    one four nine

Positionals are always parsed as decimal
    # echo ${11} ${011} ${0011}
    eleven eleven eleven

Unset positionals are just blank
    # recho "${42}"
    argv[1] = <>

Positionals are parsed soley as the digits
    # echo $7s
    sevens

Positionals are not settable via readonly or export
-- TODO: can't test these yet until we find a way to cause shells to not
-- exit on special utility failure
--  # readonly 7=september 2>/dev/null || true
--  # echo $7
--  seven
--  # set | fgrep 7=
--  # export 7=september 2>/dev/null || true
--  # echo $7
