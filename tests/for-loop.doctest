basic for loop
    # for x in a b c; do echo $x; done
    a
    b
    c
    # echo $x
    c

more cmds in the body
    # for x in 1 2; do echo a $x; echo b $x; done
    a 1
    b 1
    a 2
    b 2

no words
    # for x in; do echo $x; done

no 'in' means use positional variables
    # set a b
    # for x do echo $x; done        # note this is the original syntax!
    a
    b

the syntax is somewhat convoluted, with several distinct forms allowed:
    # for x in 1 2
    + do echo $x; done
    1
    2

    # for x in 1 2
    + do
    +    echo $x
    + done
    1
    2

    # for x
    + in 1 2 ;
    + do
    +    echo $x
    + done
    1
    2

    # for x; do echo $x; done        # not in spec, but in upcoming corrigenda
    a
    b

    # for x
    + do echo $x; done
    a
    b

    # for x
    + do
    +    echo $x
    + done
    a
    b

expand variables
    # ws='a b'
    # for x in $ws; do echo $x; done
    a
    b

return value is last cmd
    # for x in false true; do $x; done; echo $?
    0
    # for x in true false; do $x; done; echo $?
    1
    # for x in ; do $x; done; echo $?
    0

redirection
    # rm -rf /tmp/doctest
    # mkdir /tmp/doctest
    # cd /tmp/doctest
    # for x in a b; do echo $x; done >out
    # cat out
    a
    b

readonly variable aborts the loop
    # readonly x=10
    # for x in a b; do echo $x; done    # ONLY plush
    var is read-only: x
