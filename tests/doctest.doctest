Plush's functional tests are "doctest" style tests.

Text outside of execution displays is just ignored.

Execution displays start with a command to execute shown after the plush prompt.
The expected text follows immediately on the lines after, terminated by a
blank line, or another test:

    # echo Hello World
    Hello World

    # echo First test
    First test
    # echo Second test
    Second test

    # true
    # false
    # echo tests need not have results
    tests need not have results

The commands to execute can be spread out on multiple lines, using the secondary
prompt. The expected output can also be multiple lines long:

    # echo Testing &&
    + echo Multi Line
    Testing
    Multi Line

The executions are normally indented, but can be flush left too. Any amount of
indenting is acceptable so long as it is done only with spaces:

# echo outdented
outdented

    # echo indented
    indented

        # echo indented more
        indented more

If the expected output has a blank line in it, then use a line with just a
period.

    # echo indented with && echo && echo blank line above
    indented with
    .
    blank line above

Actually, any leading period on a line in the expected text is removed:

    # echo . && echo .. && echo ... && echo got it?
    ..
    ...
    ....
    .got it?

Because these test files are edited with editors that (should) replace tabs
with spaces, a tab can be represented by ⟶ in both input and output:

    # echo 'a⟶z' | tr '\t' '*'
    a*z
    # echo 'a*z' | tr '*' '\t'
    a⟶z

Some shell operations cause a "shell error", which causes the shell to exit.
While doctests are normally run as a single script, if a shell exit is expected,
then the rest of the doctest is run in a new script. An expected shell error
is indicated with an exclaimation point

    # . this-file-does-not-exist
    ! not found
    ! No such file

Becuase shell error messages are not standardized, there can be multiple
exclaimation lines, only one of which has to match. It is considered a match if
the text on the exclaimation line appears in the output.

Tests can be skipped by putting the keyword SKIP (all caps) on the command
line. Note the use of the # as a comment character, since the whole line is
still passed to shell when it isn't skipped (see below).

    # crashes                                       # SKIP
    the output is skipped, too

The skip can be limited to some test scenario(s), which is the name of the
shell under test: "plush", "sh", "bash", "dash", etc...

    # echo this test does not run in sh or bash      # SKIP sh bash
    this test does not run in sh or bash

Finally, a test can be marked ONLY, to have it run only under a given shell:

    # echo this test runs only in plush              # ONLY plush
    this test runs only in plush
