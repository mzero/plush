Tests for variables

Output is stripped of quotes, as different shells quote differently.

Set up for bash, harmless for others. Forces output of thse commands to be
in POSIX format.
    # POSIXLY_CORRECT=1

set shell variable
    # aaa=x
    # set | tr -d \'\" | fgrep aaa
    aaa=x

set empty shell variable
    # bbb=''
    # set | tr -d \'\" | fgrep bbb
    bbb=

export environment var
    # export ccc=x
    # export -p | tr -d \'\" | fgrep ccc
    export ccc=x

export empty string environment var
    # export ddd=''
    # export -p | tr -d \'\" | fgrep ddd
    export ddd=

export unassigned environment var
    # export eee
    # export -p | tr -d \'\" | fgrep eee
    export eee

echoing unassigned var acts like empty string
    # echo ">>$eee<<"
    >><<

setting exported variable remains exported
    # ccc=y
    # export -p | tr -d \'\" | fgrep ccc
    export ccc=y

set readonly shell variable
    # fff=x
    # readonly fff
    # readonly -p | tr -d \'\" | fgrep fff
    readonly fff=x
    # set | tr -d \'\" | fgrep fff
    fff=x

set readonly environment variable
    # export ggg=x
    # readonly ggg
    # readonly -p | tr -d \'\" | fgrep ggg
    readonly ggg=x
    # export -p | tr -d \'\" | fgrep ggg
    export ggg=x

set readonly unassigned environment var
    # export hhh
    # readonly hhh
    # readonly -p | tr -d \'\" | fgrep hhh
    readonly hhh
    # export -p | tr -d \'\" | fgrep hhh
    export hhh

set readonly shell variable one-shot
    # readonly iii=x
    # readonly -p | tr -d \'\" | fgrep iii
    readonly iii=x
    # set | tr -d \'\" | fgrep iii
    iii=x

export readonly variable
    # readonly jjj=x
    # export jjj
    # readonly -p | tr -d \'\" | fgrep jjj
    readonly jjj=x
    # export -p | tr -d \'\" | fgrep jjj
    export jjj=x

export readonly unassigned environment var
    # readonly kkk
    # export kkk
    # readonly -p | tr -d \'\" | fgrep kkk
    readonly kkk
    # export -p | tr -d \'\" | fgrep kkk
    export kkk

can't set readonly shell variable
Note: skipped on other shells as the error message is inconsistent
    # readonly lll=x
    # lll=y && echo succeed || echo fail        # ONLY plush
    var is read-only: lll
    fail

per-command exported variable bindings are restored after command exits
    # export mmm=1
    # mmm=2 env | fgrep mmm
    mmm=2
    # env | fgrep mmm
    mmm=1

per-command variable bindings for special built-in commands are not restored
Note: actually does the wrong thing here, and restores the binding.
    # nnn=1
    # nnn=2 set mmm=1
    # set | tr -d \'\" | fgrep nnn
    nnn=2

pipe in last test gives an error
    # dummy=test
