# This file is sourced by plush when it is run as a login shell.
# It is a a login shell if any of these are true:
#   * argv[0] starts with a '-' (login does this)
#   * invoked with --login option
#   * started in web server mode (-w)
#
# If you don't want any login processing, remove the commands from this file
# but don't delete the file: It is automatically re-created to the default
# script if it is found missing.

    # N.B.: This script will automatically be sourced by plush next if
