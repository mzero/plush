[] plumb history fetch to Job
[] return fixed history from a parsed JSON string

[] change who picks job names
[] store history

[] convert from ReportOne to Report interfaces


idea one:
    let front end name jobs
    backend stores in history via it's own ids, but reports in front-end names
    for history reporting, generates yet different front-end job names

    shell will have to keep a history counter
    already keeps front end jobs
    need a way to indicate when a job shouldn't be stored in history
    shell has to find / make history directory when it starts
    shell has to inventory previous history entries to both find new starting
        point, as well as giving front end a way to know what there is

$HOME/.plush/session/history/cmd-<date>.<time>.<n>-<cmd>

[] on start up
    mkdir -p $HOME/.plush/session/history
    -- in future need to do some interlock of some sort
    ls -l > history list
    (old, history) <- splitFromBack 500 historyList
    rm old
    initialize counter to last entry of history (or "")

[] front end request "history prior to"
    starting at newest command, read command file, parse
        add to return status
        while return size is rational
    if more to do


[] locking:
    fd <- openefile...
    setLock fd (WriteLock, AbsoluteSeek, 0, 0)
    -- throws if can't set
    -- if anyone ever closes that file (not that fd!) the lock is lost


TASKS
------
[] stamps
    [x] build stamp prefix from time
    [] save last used prefix, count
    [] if new == last, bump count
    [] file name from time+count+santized(cmd)
[x] on start up, mkdir -p $HOME/.plush/session/history
[] remove 'running: false' from FinishItem

-----------
[] on start up get filelist from history dir
[x] on history request
    [x] read each file, reply with items


[] command lines with parser errors should produce a different entry in the
   history file than just a simple stderr line





[x] split command info and output into separate files
   - 20121105.1134.0.cmd & 20121105.1134.0.out
[x] ship just commands on history request
[] request for output for a command in history
   [] back-end API end point for requesting
   [] front-end request ouptut ... as user opens? last 6 hours? until a gap?
[] kill output on full-screen
   [] back-end API for killing output
   [] send kill-output on entering full-screen
   [] handle missing output file gracefully
[] add time and working directory to command file
[] add command to "all-time" command list



API or just built-in command?

history list:
    find dir -- won't match what job is doing exactly, will it!
    enumerate dir -- easy
    read contents -- easy
    return as JSON -- easy if we don't parse it as [HistoryItem]

history output:
    find file -- easy
    return as JSON -- easy if we don't parse it as [OutputItem]

kill output:
    find file -- easy
    delete -- easy
    sync to job system no longer recording -- hard

kill command
    find files -- easy
    delete - easy
    sync to job system no longer recording -- hard
