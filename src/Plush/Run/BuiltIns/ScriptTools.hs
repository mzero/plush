    -- read's field splitting is defined with reference to section ยง2.6.5
    -- Field Splitting. However, the specification for read differs in
    -- significant ways:
    --      * yet another form of backslash quoting
    --      * a non-quoting mode (the -r flag)
    --      * handling of leading and trailing whitespace
    --      * specialing handling when there are more fields than variables
    --      * line continuation handling
    -- About the only thing that is the same is the handling of IFS.
    -- Therefore, alas, this code is a separate implementation.
