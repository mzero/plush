-- $types
-- Utilities built into the shell can be treated in several different ways.
-- The kind of utility determines the environment in which it is executed, and
-- how it may, or may not, affect shell state. The actual action for all
-- built in utilities is @'ShellUtility' m@. These types wrap that and form
-- a promise for how the utility operates.


-- | Special Built-In Utilities (ยง2.14)
-- These found without PATH search, and execute directly within the shell.
-- In particular, variable assignments made with these commands affect the
-- shell.
newtype SpecialUtility m = SpecialUtility (CommandSummary -> ShellUtility m)

-- | Direct Built-In Utilities (ยง2.9.1)
-- These are executed without PATH search. These commands may have side-effects
-- that affect the shell environment (for example cd changes the shells cwd),
-- but are invoked as if they were external commands. In particular, variable
-- assignments only affect the environment variables available to these commands
-- and not the shell's variables.
newtype DirectUtility m = DirectUtility (CommandSummary -> ShellUtility m)

-- | Regular Built-In Utilities (ยง2.9.1)
-- If PATH search succeeds in finding an executable for these, then the built-in
-- version may be executed instead. However, it is run in an environment
-- equivalent to one the executable would have run in. These built-ins can't
-- affect the shell state.
