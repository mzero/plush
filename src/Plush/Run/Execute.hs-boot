    This is the "boot" file for Plush.Run.Execute. It is used to break a module
    include cycle for GHC.

    Execution involves expansion, including command substition. Of course,
    command substition involves execution, which it does by calling execute
    directly (for $(...) form) or indirectly via script (for `...` form).
