    This is the "boot" file for Plush.Run.Builtins. It is used to break a module
    include cycle for GHC.

    The problem is that some builtin commands, in particular 'complete', need
    to be able to use the command look up machinery to be able to gather
    information about commands. However, that very machinery uses Builtins
    to be able to locate the builtin commands, which in turn depends on the
    module exporting the 'complete' command.
