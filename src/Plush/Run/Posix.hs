{-| This module represents the low level Posix interface. It is mostly a
    re-export of the interface from the System.Posix module tree. However,
    all operations in IO are instead exported as versions in (PosixIO m) => m.
    This enables code to be written to this Posix interface, but then be run
    in either IO, or in other monads that offer the implementation of Posix,
    but perhaps, don't actually affect the underlying system. See TestExec.

-- | The low-level operations that make up the Posix interface.
--
-- Where named the same as a function in 'System.Posix', see that module for
-- documentation. A few operations here are slightly higher, and replace the
-- lower level primitives. These are documented here.
--
-- These are just the operations needed to implement the shell command language
-- and the built-in commands. The shell can operate entirely within a monad
-- of this class. See 'TextExec' for one such monad. 'IO' is another.
