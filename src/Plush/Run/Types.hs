{- $exit
POSIX has a concept of "Exit Status", which is a numeric value that process
exits with at completion. It is limited to the range 0..255 by the spec.
The shell and other utilities sometimes treat 0 as "success" and other values
as "failure".

Haskell's "System.Exit" defines the type 'ExitCode', which plush reuses.
However, this type is slightly more general, in that it esparates the
notion of success and failure from the numeric code (which is only supplied
on failure). This leads to the unfortunate possibility of the value
@(ExitFailure 0)@. Is this success or failure in a POSIX context?

In the interest of harmony with Haskell's common usage, plush uses 'ExitCode'
to reprsent "Exit Status". Further, to make code clear and consistent, it
only distinguishes success from failure based on the constructor.
