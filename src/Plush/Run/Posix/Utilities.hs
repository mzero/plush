{-| This module represents the low level Posix interface. It is mostly a
    re-export of the interface from the System.Posix module tree. However,
    all operations in IO are instead exported as versions in (PosixIO m) => m.
    This enables code to be written to this Posix interface, but then be run
    in either IO, or in other monads that offer the implementation of Posix,
    but perhaps, don't actually affect the underlying system. See TestExec.
